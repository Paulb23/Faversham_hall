In order to solve the pipes, you must control the flow of the water. Select the piece you want with the (W,S) keys
and then rotate the piece in order to complete the pipe lineup with the (A,D) keys. Once everything is lined up to your satisfaction
press (e) to flow the water. Be careful, though - If you don't succeed the puzzle will reset and you will need to start again!
